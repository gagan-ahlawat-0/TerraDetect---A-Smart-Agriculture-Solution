# TerraDetect Frontend

This directory contains the static assets (CSS, JS, images) and HTML templates for the TerraDetect web application.

- All user-facing pages (login, register, dashboard, etc.) are in `templates/`.
- All static files (stylesheets, scripts, images) are in `static/`.

The frontend is served by the Flask backend. No separate build step is required.

For backend/API setup, see `../backend/README.md`.
